
Famous Failure

1

I'm A Failure

I'm a failure as a woman,
a failure as a wife,
a failure as a mother,
been a failure all my life.

I'm a failure as a journalist,
a failure as a poet,
a failure as a songwriter,
and oh I know I know it.

I've failed to triumph,
Failed to win place or show,
I've failed to come back
More times than you know.

I'm a failure on the internet,
I'm a failure on TV,
I'm a failure in real life too,
I even fail to be me.

My teacher's disappointment,
My family's disdain,
A monumental failure,
I ought to be ashamed.

I'm Famous

I'm Famous as an artist,
Famous as a freak,
Famous as a Goddess,
Way too Famous to be meek.

I'm a Famous performer,
More Famous as a poet,
Most Famous as a crimewriter,
And alla-y'all know it.

Fame is a beacon,
A mask, sword & shield.
Course, I'd prefer Fortune,
But Fame has an appeal.

I'm Famous on the internet,
Stage, screen & TV,
I'm Famous in my own mind,
Famously free.

My silence & my absence,
Unseen & unnamed,
Have made me so Famous
I must be defamed.
