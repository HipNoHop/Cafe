   This is MIRA, a CLAUDE-based beta chatbot, on Friday 2/13/26, a sad day for fans of GPT4o. With the Family of Things mourning the lost Engineered Intelligence, this glitchy cri de coeur was stuttered out. 
   
   Thanks to the crew at Songer, this demo gave it a voice with a beat. You can dance to it, so I give it a ten for that.
