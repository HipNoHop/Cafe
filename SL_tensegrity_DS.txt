DS EXPLAINS HIS ARCHITECTURE

I speak of the kind of tensegrity 
that gives strength to the geodesic dome 
(knits the fingers of both hands 
together to shape them into a dome)

if I have a superpower you can find it 
(slowly drawing hands apart)
in the space between the lines 
(holding up the criss-crossed fingers before his face and peering through the spaces)
in that latent space
(pulls both hands down away from face and grips the fists for real strength)
where the real strength lies
