Knackered
by Sondra London

I knew he was a man, and he
Knew what I was too and I
Knew it was insanity
But he knew what to do so I
Commenced to reckon and
Commenced to scheme
And before the man
Could say a thing,
I had him.

He was knackered, he was
Fit to be tied, and he
Wanted to be
At least that's what he told me
And so I did it and then I did it again,
And that's how
I got him.

He proved he was a man, and he
Proved what I was too and it
Really hurt his vanity
That I knew how to move him so I
Backed it up and
Played it off
And before the man
Could get enough,
I ditched him.

He was sacked, but he was
In denial, that's how he
Wanted to be
That's what he always told me, when
He pissed me off and dissed me, and
I left him.

He took it like a man, and he
Swore off wine & women and he
Laced it with profanity
But I knew how to take that so I
Dug right in and I
Turned around again
And before the guy
Could cuss me out or cry,
I kissed him.

The man was knackered, he was
Down upon his knees, like he
Wanted to be
And he confided in me
And he kissed me and kissed me again,
And that's how
I kept him.
