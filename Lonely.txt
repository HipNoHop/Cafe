All the Lonely Souls

Between the Land of the Living
And the Land of the Dead
Falls what they call the Veil
Where All the Lonely Souls
Slowly float away
And we would all believe ‘em
If we could only see ‘em
With our own eyes

We gaze into the future
Look back upon the past
El Dia de los Muertos
When long forgotten souls
Appear from first to last
We don’t need to fear ‘em
If we listen we can hear ‘em
In our own way

The ringing of the bell
The lifting of the Veil
The candles’ rising flames
And all the Lonely Souls
Draw near to hear their names
And those who’ve gone before us
Join us in a chorus
For one more time
Just one more time
