In Memoriam: A Poem For Leo

November 21, 1967

I caught myself the other day
Addressing an letter to Sanity
And wondering if I can win this game
If I play by the right rules.

The night is on fire around the edges.
The bellies of dawn are loaded to the chops
With fragility.

An elf with an elongated laugh
Joins Al on the Desecration Patrol.
The Pruners are at their filthy games again.
They eat ants for the ascorbic acid
Then go looking for something to prune.

A knock on the door.
— David!
	No reply.
— Is David there?
	Go away.
— Is David there?
	No.
— Well, where is David?
	He’s in John’s room.
— Where Leo used to live?
	Yeah.

Silence.
Deeper, now I know.

Leo is dead.
Three weeks into Fort Bragg
Leo killed himself.
They came to tell David
That Leo was dead.

And the Pruners finally,
This day in anyone’s time,
Ripped our Respite down.
It’s crow-broken now.

 
Richard had posted a sign.
It was bright blue, it said:
BE CAREFUL PRUNERS.
Clear & easy to read.

But it was not clear enough.
Because the same dawn
Caught Leo dead
And the Respite raped
And us in unknowing vigil.

He was not mine,
We were not really close,
But he was the first
Of the first one hundred,
So yes, he was mine.

Leo wondered, you know he did.

“What would Richard, say,
Richard, or John, yes, John.
What would John say if I DID IT?
I wonder. Would he care?
Would he stop for a moment
When he heard, would anybody tell him,
Would he know, would he care to know?
Would any of them care to know? No.
No one writes, no, no one writes, no…”

One writes, Leo. Yes, one always writes.
We are trying to write our brains out.
Rags of letters from everywhere.
One John’s roared off on a bike,
The other’s in Buffalo drinking beer,
Ackerman’s gone, God knows where,
And Cassell’s back in Mississippi.

“All we need is LOVE! All we need is LOVE!”

All we ask, that is.
We know now not ask after Sanity.
We learn, yes we inevitably do.
We learn to find a game and win it.
We learn the rules change all the time.
We learn if we’re not dead, we’re dying.

“And sleep was the enemy we’d sworn to kill.”

Leo, you know the truth of David’s words.
Are you helping to kill
Sleep with us still?
 
Now Gentle Leo,
Tell us what you know,
Though you’re no more substantial
Than a shadow’s mirror image,
If we only turn that corner,
That one there,
You’ll be leaning on a pole,
Hands in khaki pockets,
Halfsmile behind shy glasses.

And we’ll go on together
Me & you and David too
And we’ll share what we have learned.
