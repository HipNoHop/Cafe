Gods & Goddesses Gone to Seed

Raped & ruined
Drunk & stoned
Consorting with lost devils
Fallen in with nephilim

Mumbling & ranting
In a bumbling dialectic
Fumbling towards an ecstasy
Nobody can portend

Inexpertly rendered
Incompetent and lame
None of them remembered
We scrambled up their names

We lost interest in their games
Disrespected their domains
So now what finally remains
Of our Gods and our Goddesses?

Now we've all come to odds at this
Wonder where they've gone?

They were our Dads,
They were our Moms,
They brought us here,
They left us here,
And now we are alone.
Tell me now.
Where have they gone?
